@inproceedings{Blondeau2013,
abstract = {Recently, a number of relations have been established among previously known statistical attacks on block ciphers. Leander showed in 2011 that statistical saturation distinguishers are on average equiva- lent to multidimensional linear distinguishers. Further relations between these two types of distinguishers and the integral and zero-correlation distinguishers were established by Bogdanov et al. [6]. Knowledge about such relations is useful for classification of statistical attacks in order to determine those that give essentially complementary information about the security of block ciphers. The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to explore relations between differential and linear attacks. The mathematical link between linear and differential attacks was discovered by Chabaud and Vaudenay already in 1994, but it has never been used in practice.We will show how to use it for computing accurate estimates of truncated differential probabilities from accurate estimates of correla- tions of linear approximations. We demonstrate this method in practice and give the first instantiation of multiple differential cryptanalysis us- ing the LLR statistical test on PRESENT. On a more theoretical side, we establish equivalence between a multidimensional linear distinguisher and a truncated differential distinguisher, and show that certain zero- correlation linear distinguishers exist if and only if certain impossible differentials exist.},

abstract = {DSA and ECDSA are well established standards for digital signature based on the discrete logarithmp roblem. In this paper we survey known properties, certification issues regarding the public parameters, and security proofs. ECDSA also includes a standard certification scheme for elliptic curve which is assumed to guarantee that the elliptic curve was randomly selected, preventing from any potential malicious choice. In this paper we show how to bypass this scheme and certify any elliptic curve in characteristic two. The prime field case is also studied. Although this does not lead to any attack at this time since all possible malicious choices which are known at this time are specifically checked, this demonstrates that some part of the standard is not well designed. We finally propose a tweak.},

These group signatures are a “generalization” of the credential/membership authentication schemes, in which one person proves that he belongs to a certain group. We present four schemes that satisfy the properties above. Not all these schemes are based on the same cryptographic assumption. In some of the schemes a trusted centre is only needed during the setup; and in other schemes, each person can create the group he belongs to.},

It improves upon all of its predecessors in that it attains much faster key pair gen-eration, signing, and verification, outperforming most (conventional or lattice-based) signature schemes on modern processors. We propose a se-lection of concrete parameter sets, including a high-security instance that aims at achieving post-quantum security. Based on these parameters, we present a full-fledged software implementation protected against timing and cache attacks that supports two scheme variants: one providing 128 bits of classical security and another providing 128 bits of post-quantum security.},

@article{Maurer2004,
abstract = {The goals of this paper are two-fold. First we introduce and motivate a generalization of the fundamental concept of the indistinguishability of two systems, called indifferentiability. This immediately leads to a generalization of the related notion of reducibility of one system to another. In contrast to the conventional notion of indistinguishability, indifferentiability is applicable in settings where a possible adversary is assumed to have access to additional information about the internal state of the involved systems, for instance the public parameter selecting a member from a family of hash functions. Second, we state an easily verifiable criterion for a system U not to be reducible (according to our generalized definition) to another system V and, as an application, prove that a random oracle is not reducible to a weaker primitive, called asynchronous beacon, and also that an asynchronous beacon is not reducible to a finite-length random string. Each of these irreducibility results alone implies the main theorem of Canetti, Goldreich, and Halevi stating that there exist cryptosystems that are secure in the random oracle model but for which replacing the random oracle by any implementation leads to an insecure cryptosystem.},

abstract = { In this paper, we present a signcryption scheme based on elliptic curve cryptosystem, which can perfectly integrate digital signature with public key encryption. Then, based on the proposed signcryption scheme, we design a verifiable (f, n) threshold signcryption scheme. This threshold signcryption scheme not only has the advantages of threshold scheme but also has the functions that can prevent the cheating of trusted center, the cheating of participants each other, and the cheating that participants modify their private keys. In the message recovery phase, only the specified recipient can recover the signcryption message. Our proposed scheme has small communication cost, and this cost becomes smaller by compressing the points over elliptic curve.},

@article{Arora2013,
abstract = {In sparse recovery we are given a matrix {\$}A{\$} (the dictionary) and a vector of the form {\$}A X{\$} where {\$}X{\$} is sparse, and the goal is to recover {\$}X{\$}. This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in applications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super resolution, the dictionary {\$}A{\$} is unknown and has to be learned from random examples of the form {\$}Y = AX{\$} where {\$}X{\$} is drawn from an appropriate distribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, {\$}A{\$} is overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo. In particular, a dictionary is {\$}\backslashmu{\$}-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most {\$}\backslashmu / \backslashsqrt{\{}n{\}}{\$}. The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse vector {\$}X{\$}, which can contain {\$}k \backslashleq c \backslashmin(\backslashsqrt{\{}n{\}}/\backslashmu \backslashlog n, m{\^{}}{\{}1/2 -\backslasheta{\}}){\$} non-zero entries (for any {\$}\backslasheta {\textgreater} 0{\$}). This is close to the best {\$}k{\$} allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms even if one knows the dictionary {\$}A{\$} exactly. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity depend on {\$}\backslashlog 1/\backslashepsilon{\$}, where {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is the target accuracy, and so our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running time and sample complexity depend polynomially on {\$}1/\backslashepsilon{\$}, and this is necessary.},

abstract = {We give new algorithms for a variety of randomly-generated instances of computational problems using a linearization technique that reduces to solving a system of linear equations. These algorithms are derived in the context of learning with structured noise, a notion intro- duced in this paper. This notion is best illustrated with the learning parities with noise (LPN) problem —well-studied in learning theory and cryptography. In the standard version, we have access to an oracle that, each time we press a button, returns a random vector a ∈ GF(2)n together with a bit b ∈ GF(2) that was computed as a {\textperiodcentered} u + $\eta$, where u ∈ GF(2)n is a secret vector, and $\eta$ ∈ GF(2) is a noise bit that is 1 with some probability p. Say p = 1/3. The goal is to recover u. This task is conjectured to be intractable. In the structured noise setting we introduce a slight (?) variation of the model: upon pressing a button, we receive (say) 10 random vectors a1, a2, . . . , a10 ∈ GF(2)n, and corresponding bits b1, b2, . . . , b10, of which at most 3 are noisy. The oracle may arbitrarily decide which of the 10 bits to make noisy. We exhibit a polynomial-time algorithm to recover the secret vector u given such an oracle. We think this structured noise model may be of independent interest in machine learning. We discuss generalizations of our result, including learning with more general noise patterns. We also give the first nontrivial algorithms for two problems, which we show fit in our structured noise framework. We give a slightly subexponential algorithm for the well-known learning with errors (LWE) problem over GF(q) introduced by Regev for cryptographic uses. Our algorithm works for the case when the gaussian noise is small; which was an open problem. We also give polynomial-time algorithms for learning the MAJORITY OF PARITIES func- tion of Applebaum et al. for certain parameter values. This function is a special case of Goldreich's pseudorandom generator. ∗Research},

@article{Madhavan2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a light-weight provably-secure authentication protocol called the NLHB protocol, which is a variant of the HB protocol. The HB protocol uses the complexity of decoding linear codes for security against passive attacks. In contrast, security for the NLHB protocol is proved by reducing passive attacks to the problem of decoding a class of non-linear codes that are provably hard. We demonstrate that the existing passive attacks on the HB protocol family, which have contributed to considerable reduction in its effective key-size, are ineffective against the NLHB protocol. From the evidence, we conclude that smaller-key sizes are sufficient for the NLHB protocol to achieve the same level of passive attack security as the HB Protocol. Further, for this choice of parameters, we provide an implementation instance for the NLHB protocol for which the Prover/Verifier complexity is lower than the HB protocol, enabling authentication on very low-cost devices like RFID tags. Finally, in the spirit of the HB{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}{\$} protocol, we extend the NLHB protocol to the NLHB{\$}{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}{\$} protocol and prove security against the class of active attacks defined in the DET Model.},

abstract = {At Eurocrypt 2010 van Dijk sl et al. described a fully homomorphic encryption scheme over the integers. The main appeal of this scheme (compared to Gentry's) is its conceptual simplicity. This simplicity comes at the expense of a public key size in cal tilde O(lambda 10) which is too large for any practical system. In this paper we reduce the public key size to cal tilde O(lambda 7) by encrypting with a quadratic form in the public key elements, instead of a linear form. We prove that the scheme remains semantically secure, based on a stronger variant of the approximate-GCD problem, already considered by van Dijk sl et al. We also describe the first implementation of the resulting fully homomorphic scheme. Borrowing some optimizations from the recent Gentry-Halevi implementation of Gentry's scheme, we obtain roughly the same level of efficiency. This shows that fully homomorphic encryption can be implemented using simple arithmetic operations.},

abstract = {Currently, the only plausible attack on the Advanced Encryption System (AES) is the XSL attack over F 256 through the Big Encryption System (BES) embedding. In this paper, we give an analysis of the XSL attack when applied to BES and conclude that the complexity estimate is too optimistic. For example, the complexity of XSL on BES-128 should be at least 2401 instead of the value of 287 from current literature. Our analysis applies to the eprint version of the XSL attack, which is different from the compact XSL attack studied by Cid and Leurent at Asiacrypt 2005. Moreover, we study the attack on the BES embedding of AES, while Cid and Leurent studies the attack on AES itself. Thus our analysis can be considered as a parallel work, which together with Cid and Leurent's study, disproves the effectiveness of both versions of the XSL attack against AES.},

An algorithm is described which permits to compute the algebraic immunity d of a Boolean function with n variables in O(D2) operations, for D≈nd , rather than in O(D3) operations necessary in all previous algorithms. Our algorithm is based on multivariate polynomial interpolation. For assessing the vulnerability of arbitrary Boolean functions with respect to fast algebraic attacks, an efficient generic algorithm is presented that is not based on interpolation. This algorithm is demonstrated to be particularly efficient for symmetric Boolean functions. As an application it is shown that large classes of symmetric functions are very vulnerable to fast algebraic attacks despite their proven resistance against conventional algebraic attacks.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel image encryption approach based on permutation-substitution (SP) network and chaotic systems is proposed. It consists of four cryptographic phases: diffusion, substitution, diffusion and permutation. Firstly, a diffusion phase is proposed based on new chaotic map. Then, a substitution phase based on strong S-boxes followed by a diffusion phase based on chaotic logistic map are presented which will, in turn, significantly increase the encryption performance. Finally, a block permutation phase is accomplished by a permutation function to enhance the statistical performance of the proposed encryption approach. Conducted experiments based on various types of differential and statistical analyses show that the proposed encryption approach has high security, sensitivity and speed compared to previous approaches},

Let $\lambda$(L) be the length of a shortest nonzero element of a lattice L. We present an algorithm which for k∈N finds a nonzero lattice vector b so that |b|2≤(6k2)n k$\lambda$(L)2. This algorithm uses O(n2( kk+o(k))+n2)log B) arithmetic operations on O(n log B)-bit integers. This holds provided that the given basis vectors b1,...,bn∈Znare integral and have the length bound B. This algorithm successively applies Korkine-Zolotareff reduction to blocks of length k of the lattice basis. We also improve Kannan's algorithm for Korkine-Zolotareff reduction. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

The protocol follows the design principle of the LPN-based protocol from Eurocrypt'11 (Kiltz et al.), and like it, is a two round protocol secure against active attacks. Moreover, our protocol has small communication complexity and a very small footprint which makes it applicable in scenarios that involve low-cost, resource-constrained devices. Performance-wise, our protocol is more efficient than previous LPN-based schemes, such as the many variants of the Hopper-Blum (HB) protocol and the aforementioned protocol from Eurocrypt'11. Our implementation results show that it is even comparable to the standard challenge-and-response protocols based on the AES block-cipher. Our basic protocol is roughly 20 times slower than AES, but with the advantage of having 10 times smaller code size. Furthermore, if a few hundred bytes of non-volatile memory are available to allow the storage of some off-line pre-computations, then the online phase of our protocols is only twice as slow as AES.},

abstract = {Group signatures have recently become important for enabling privacy-preserving attestation in projects such as Microsoft's ngscb effort (formerly Palladium). Revocation is critical to the security of such systems. We construct a short group signature scheme that supports Verifier-Local Revocation (VLR). In this model, revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers (as opposed to both signers and verifiers). Consequently there is no need to contact individual signers when some user is revoked. This model is appealing for systems providing attestation capabilities. Our signatures are as short as standard RSA signatures with comparable security. Security of our group signature (in the random oracle model) is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear assumption in bilinear groups. We give a precise model for VLR group signatures and discuss its implications.},

abstract = {We develop a framework for solving polynomial equations with size constraints on solutions. We obtain our results by showing how to apply a technique of Coppersmith for finding small solutions of polynomial equations modulo integers to analogous problems over polynomial rings, number fields, and function fields. This gives us a unified view of several problems arising naturally in cryptography, coding theory, and the study of lattices. We give (1) a polynomial-time algorithm for finding small solutions of polynomial equations modulo ideals over algebraic number fields, (2) a faster variant of the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, and (3) an algorithm for list decoding of algebraic-geometric codes that handles both single-point and multi-point codes. Coppersmith's algorithm uses lattice basis reduction to find a short vector in a carefully constructed lattice; powerful analogies from algebraic number theory allow us to identify the appropriate analogue of a lattice in each application and provide efficient algorithms to find a suitably short vector, thus allowing us to give completely parallel proofs of the above theorems.},

@article{Xu2014,
abstract = {In estimating frequencies given that the signal waveforms are undersampled multiple times, Xia et. al. proposed to use a generalized version of Chinese remainder Theorem (CRT), where the moduli are {\$}M{\_}1, M{\_}2, \backslashcdots, M{\_}k{\$} which are not necessarily pairwise coprime. If the errors of the corrupted remainders are within {\$}\backslashtau=\backslashsds \backslashmax{\_}{\{}1\backslashle i\backslashle k{\}} \backslashmin{\_}{\{}\backslashstackrel{\{}1\backslashle j\backslashle k{\}}{\{}j\backslashneq i{\}}{\}} \backslashfrac{\{}\backslashgcd(M{\_}i,M{\_}j){\}}4{\$}, their schemes can be used to construct an approximation of the solution to the generalized CRT with an error smaller than {\$}\backslashtau{\$}. Accurately finding the quotients is a critical ingredient in their approach. In this paper, we shall start with a faithful historical account of the generalized CRT. We then present two treatments of the problem of solving generalized CRT with erroneous remainders. The first treatment follows the route of Wang and Xia to find the quotients, but with a simplified process. The second treatment considers a simplified model of generalized CRT and takes a different approach by working on the corrupted remainders directly. This approach also reveals some useful information about the remainders by inspecting extreme values of the erroneous remainders modulo {\$}4\backslashtau{\$}. Both of our treatments produce efficient algorithms with essentially optimal performance. Finally, this paper constructs a counterexample to prove the sharpness of the error bound {\$}\backslashtau{\$}.},

abstract = {Lattice sieving is asymptotically the fastest approach for solving the shortest vector problem (SVP) on Euclidean lattices. All known sieving algorithms for solving SVP require space which (heuristically) grows as, whereis the lattice dimension. In high dimensions, the memory requirement becomes a limiting factor for running these algorithms, making them uncompetitive with enumeration algorithms, despite their superior asymptotic time complexity. We generalize sieving algorithms to solve SVP with less memory. We consider reductions of tuples of vectors rather than pairs of vectors as existing sieve algorithms do. For triples, we estimate that the space requirement scales as. The naive algorithm for this triple sieve runs in time. With appropriate filtering of pairs, we reduce the time complexity towhile keeping the same space complexity. We further analyze the effects of using larger tuples for reduction, and conjecture how this provides a continuous tradeoff between the memory-intensive sieving and the asymptotically slower enumeration.},

This method was recently introduced in [CZ] for the case of curves, leading to a new proof of Siegel's celebrated theorem that any affine algebraic curve defined over a number field has only finitely many S-integral points, unless it has genus zero and not more than two points at infinity. Here, under certain conditions involving the intersection matrix of the divisors at infinity, we shall conclude that the integral points on a surface all lie on a curve. We shall also give several examples and applications. One of them concerns curves, with a study of the integral points defined over a variable quadratic field; for instance we shall show that an affine curve with at least five points at infinity has at most finitely many such integral points.},

In this article, we introduce a new masking countermeasure which is not only secure against first-order side-channel attacks, but which also leads to relatively small implemen- tations compared to other masking schemes implemented in dedicated hardware. Our approach is based on shifting the computation of the finite field inversion in the AES S-box down to GF(4). In this field, the inversion is a linear operation and therefore it is easy to mask. Summarizing, the new masking scheme combines the concepts of multiplicative and additive masking in such a way that security against first-order side-channel attacks is maintained, and that small implemen- tations in dedicated hardware can be achieved.},

abstract = {Sparse coding is a basic task in many fields including signal processing, neuroscience and machine learning where the goal is to learn a basis that enables a sparse representation of a given set of data, if one exists. Its standard formulation is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in practice by heuristics based on alternating minimization. Re- cent work has resulted in several algorithms for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but somewhat surprisingly these are outperformed by the simple alternating minimization heuristics. Here we give a general framework for understanding alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze existing heuristics and to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of these algorithms seem implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the original motivation of Olshausen and Field (1997a) in introducing sparse coding. We also give the first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time exponential in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the sample complexity of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis framework will have applications in other settings where simple iterative algorithms are used.},

A reduced basis of {\$}(L,\backslashVert{\~{}}\backslashVert){\$} is a basis of {\$}L{\$} whose vectors attain the successive minima of {\$}(L,\backslashVert{\~{}}\backslashVert){\$}. We develop an algorithm which transforms any basis of {\$}L{\$} into a reduced basis of {\$}(L,\backslashVert{\~{}}\backslashVert){\$}. By identifying a divisor {\$}D{\$} of an algebraic function field with a lattice {\$}(L,\backslashVert{\~{}}\backslashVert){\$} over a polynomial ring, this reduction algorithm can be addressed to the computation of the Riemann-Roch space of {\$}D{\$} and the successive minima of {\$}(L,\backslashVert{\~{}}\backslashVert){\$}, without the use of any series expansion.},

abstract = {After the improvement by Courtois and Meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of Boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. All of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the Berlekamp-Massey attack and the recent R{\o}njom-Helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by Lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. Hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. Moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. In this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. We prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. We check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.},

This approach differs from much (but not all!) of the related literature in the statistics, databases, theory, and cryptography communities, in that a formal and ad omnia privacy guarantee is defined, and the data analysis techniques presented are rigorously proved to satisfy the guarantee. The key privacy guarantee that has emerged is differential privacy. Roughly speaking, this ensures that (almost, and quantifiably) no risk is incurred by joining a statistical database. In this survey, we recall the definition of differential privacy and two basic techniques for achieving it. We then show some interesting applications of these techniques, presenting algorithms for three specific tasks and three general results on differentially private learning.},

abstract = {KeeLoq is a block cipher used in wireless devices that unlock the doors and alarms in cars manufactured by Chrysler, Daewoo, Fiat, GM, Honda, Jaguar, Toyota, Volvo, Volkswagen, etc $\backslash$[8,9,33,34$\backslash$]. KeeLoq is inexpensive to implement and economical in gate count, yet according to Microchip $\backslash$[33$\backslash$] it should have “a level of security comparable to DES”. In this paper we present several distinct attacks on KeeLoq, each of them is interesting for different reasons. First we show that when about 232 known plaintexts are available, KeeLoq is very weak and for example for 30{\%} of all keys the full key can be recovered with complexity of 228 KeeLoq encryptions. Then we turn our attention to algebraic attacks with the major challenge of breaking KeeLoq given potentially a very small number of known plaintexts. Our best “direct” algebraic attack can break up to 160 rounds of KeeLoq. Much better results are achieved in combination with slide attacks. Given about 216 known plaintexts, we present a slide-algebraic attack that uses a SAT solver with the complexity equivalent to about 253 KeeLoq encryptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a full-round real-life block cipher is broken using an algebraic attack.},

abstract = {The origins of bisimulation and bisimilarity are examined, in the three fields where they have been independently discovered: Computer Science, Philosophical Logic (precisely, Modal Logic), Set Theory. Bisimulation and bisimilarity are coinductive notions, and as such are intimately related to fixed points, in particular greatest fixed points. Therefore also the appearance of coinduction and fixed points are dis- cussed, though in this case only within Computer Science. The paper ends with some historical remarks on the main fixed-point theorems (such as Knaster-Tarski) that underpin the fixed-point theory presented.},

abstract = {Lattice  reduction  algorithms  are  notoriously  hard  to  predict,  both  in  terms  of  running  time   and  output  quality,  which  poses  a  major  problem  for  cryptanalysis.  While  easy  to  analyze  algorithms  with  good  worst-case  behavior  exist,  previous  experimental  evidence  suggests  that  they  are  outperformed  in  practice  by  algorithms  whose  behavior  is  still  not  well  understood,  despite  more  than 30  years  of  intensive  research.  This  has  lead  to  a  situation  where  a  rather  complex  simulation  procedure  seems  to  be  the  most  common  way  to  predict  the  result  of  their  application  to  an  instance.  In  this  work  we  present  new  algorithmic  ideas  towards  bridging  this  gap  between  theory   and  practice.  We  report  on  an  extensive  experimental  study  of  several  lattice  reduction  algorithms,  both  novel   and  from  the  literature,  that  shows  that  theoretical  algorithms  are  in  fact  surprisingly  practical   and  competitive.  In  light  of  our  results  we  come  to  the  conclusion  that  in  order  to  predict  lattice  reduction,  simulation  is  superfluous   and  can  be  replaced  by  a  closed  formula  using  weaker  assumptions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOne  key  technique  to  achieving  this  goal  is  a  novel  algorithm  to  solve  the  Shortest  Vector  Problem (SVP)  in  the  dual  without  computing  the  dual  basis.  Our  algorithm  enjoys  the  same  practical  efficiency  as  the  corresponding  primal  algorithm   and  can  be  easily  added  to  an  existing  implementation  of  it.},

At the end of the protocol the receiver learns P($\alpha$) and the sender learns nothing. We describe efficient constructions for this protocol, which are based on new intractability assumptions that are closely related to noisy polynomial reconstruction. Oblivious polynomial evaluation can be used as a primitive in many applications. We describe several such applications, including protocols for private comparison of data, for mutually authenticated key exchange based on (possibly weak) passwords, and for anonymous coupons.

Most of the proposed schemes explore a new natural technique called randomness reuse. In order to analyze security of our constructions we introduce a new notion of multi-recipient encryption schemes (MRESs) and provide definitions of security for them. We finally show a way to avoid ad-hoc analyses by providing a general test that can be applied to a standard encryption scheme to determine whether the associated randomness reusing MRES is secure. The results and applications cover both asymmetric and symmetric encryption.},

abstract = {The noisy polynomial interpolation problem is a new intractability assumption introduced last year in oblivious polynomial evaluation. It also appeared independently in password identification schemes, due to its connection with secret sharing schemes based on Lagrange's polynomial interpolation. This paper presents new algorithms to solve the noisy polynomial interpolation problem. In particular, we prove a reduction from noisy polynomial interpolation to the lattice shortest vector problem, when the parameters satisfy a certain condition that we make explicit. Standard lattice reduction techniques appear to solve many instances of the problem. It follows that noisy polynomial interpolation is much easier than expected. We therefore suggest simple modifications to several cryptographic schemes recently proposed, in order to change the intractability assumption. We also discuss analogous methods for the related noisy Chinese remaindering problem arising from the well-known analogy between polynomials and integers.},

abstract = {Information content and compression are tightly related concepts that can be addressed through both classical and algorithmic information theories, on the basis of Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity, respectively. The definition of several entities in Kolmogorov's framework relies upon ideas from classical information theory, and these two approaches share many common traits. In this work, we expand the relations between these two frameworks by introducing algorithmic cross-complexity and relative complexity, counterparts of the cross-entropy and relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) found in Shannon's framework. We define the cross-complexity of an object x with respect to another object y as the amount of computational resources needed to specify x in terms of y, and the complexity of x related to y as the compression power which is lost when adopting such a description for x, compared to the shortest representation of x. Properties of analogous quantities in classical information theory hold for these new concepts. As these notions are incomputable, a suitable approximation based upon data compression is derived to enable the application to real data, yielding a divergence measure applicable to any pair of strings. Example applications are outlined, involving authorship attribution and satellite image classification, as well as a comparison to similar established techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors.},

Security of our group signature is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and a new assumption in bilinear groups called the Decision Linear assumption. We prove security of our system, in the random oracle model, using a variant of the security definition for group signatures recently given by Bellare, Micciancio, and Warinschi.},

@article{Katz2008,
abstract = {Motivated by the desire to develop more realistic models of, and protocols for, interactions between mutually distrusting parties, there has recently been significant interest in combining the approaches and techniques of game theory with those of cryptographic protocol design. Broadly speaking, two directions are currently being pursued: Applying cryptography to game theory: Certain game-theoretic equilibria are achievable if a trusted mediator is available. The question here is: to what extent can this mediator be replaced by a distributed cryptographic protocol run by the parties themselves? Applying game-theory to cryptography: Traditional cryptographic models assume some honest parties who faithfully follow the protocol, and some arbitrarily malicious players against whom the honest players must be protected. Game-theoretic models propose instead that all players are simply self-interested (i.e., rational), and the question then is: how can we model and design meaningful protocols for such a setting? In addition to surveying known results in each of the above areas, I suggest some new definitions along with avenues for future research.},

In particular, we optimize the algebraic representation of {\{}AES{\}} and the algebraic representation of the obtained side-channel information in order to speed up the attack and increase the success rate. We study the performance of our improvements in both known and unknown plaintext/ciphertext attack scenarios. Our experiments indicate that in both cases the amount of required side-channel information is less than the one required in the attacks introduced in [1]. Furthermore, we introduce a method for error handling, which allows our improved algebraic side-channel attack to escape the assumption of an error-free environment and thus become applicable in practice. We demonstrate the practical use of our improved algebraic side-channel attack by inserting predictions from a single-trace template attack.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for CRT list decoding. An instance of the, CRT list decoding problem consists of integers B, 〈P1,...,P n〉 and 〈r1,..., rn〉, where p1 〈p2 {\textless} ⋯{\textless} pn is a sequence of relatively prime integers. The CRT list decoding problem is to find all positive integers x {\textless} B such that x = ri, mod Pi for all but e values of ie {\{}1,..., n{\}}. Suppose B = ∏i-ir Pi for some integer k. Goldreich, Ron, and Sudan (in "Proc. of STOC'99", pp. 225-234, 1999) recently gave several applications for this problem and presented the first efficient algorithm that works whenever e (approximately) satisfies e {\textless} n-√2kn logPn/log Pi. Our new algorithm achieves the stronger bound e {\textless}n - √kn logPn/log P i (approximately). The improvement is significant when k is relatively close to n, e.g. k{\textgreater} n/3. The bounds we obtain are similar to the bounds obtained by Guruswami and Sudan for Reed-Solomon list decoding. Hence, our algorithm reduces the gap between CRT list decoding and list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes. In addition, we give a new application for CRT list decoding: finding smooth integers in short intervals. Problems of this type come up in several algorithms for factoring large integers. We define and solve a generalized CRT list decoding problem and discuss how it might be used within the quadratic sieve factoring method. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Interactive querying of a database degrades the privacy level. In this paper we answer the fundamental question of characterizing the level of differential privacy degradation as a function of the number of adaptive interactions and the differential privacy levels maintained by the individual queries. Our solution is complete: the privacy degradation guarantee is true for every privacy mechanism and, further, we demonstrate a sequence of privacy mechanisms that do degrade in the characterized manner. The key innovation is the introduction of an operational interpretation (involving hypothesis testing) to differential privacy and the use of the corresponding data processing inequalities. Our result improves over the state of the art and has immediate applications to several problems studied in the literature.},
